"""The Learning Engine: observe recorded history, recall it for the next run.

Two phases, deliberately mirroring the ``HistoryEngine.record`` / ``augment``
split proven in M4:

* :meth:`observe` runs every registered learner over the whole corpus and
  replaces the stored artifacts. Pure: same history in, byte-identical
  artifacts out, regardless of when it runs or what order runs arrived in.
* :meth:`recall` projects the stored artifacts into a :class:`LearningContext`
  for one upcoming investigation, and :meth:`augment` attaches the
  signature-specific part once the run has produced one.

The engine remembers. It does not decide. Everything it emits is a hint or a
bounded calibration multiplier, both of which carry the regression IDs they
were learned from, and neither of which can create a hypothesis, change a
classification, or touch the Evidence Graph.
