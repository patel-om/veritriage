"""The built-in learner library.

Importing this package registers every built-in learner. Each module is
self-contained and reaches the engine through ``@register_learner`` alone, so
adding an eighth family means adding a module here (or anywhere else) and
nothing more, which ``test_new_learner_needs_only_registration`` proves.
