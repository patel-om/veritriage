"""The Learning Store: a rebuildable, derived view over recorded history.

A separate SQLite file from the regression database on purpose. The regression
database is the immutable record of what happened; the learning store is a
derived projection of it. Deleting the learning store loses nothing that cannot
be recomputed, and returns the platform to exact pre-M13 behavior, which is a
testable property rather than a claim.

Standard library only, matching `storage/sqlite.py`. Artifacts are stored as
complete JSON with their kind, so the typed subclass is reconstructed on read
and nothing is summarized away.
