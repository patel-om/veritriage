"""The context provider interface: the ONLY tool-aware code in the platform.

A provider's whole and only job is to turn one engineering system's state (a
git repository, a CI export, a review system, a tracker) into normalized
:class:`~veritriage.engineering.model.EngineeringContext`. It may shell out to
a tool binary or read tool exports, but under the lossy-by-design law it may
only emit normalized summaries: no diff text, no patch content, no raw tool
payloads survive outside the provider. Providers never touch the Evidence
Graph, reasoning, or AI.

Add a new engineering system (GitHub, GitLab, Perforce, Gerrit, Jenkins,
Jira, DOORS, internal tooling) by writing a new ``ContextProvider`` subclass
and registering it. Nothing else in the platform changes; the architecture
tests in ``tests/test_engineering.py`` prove it.
