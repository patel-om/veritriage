"""Normalized, tool-independent engineering context models (Milestone 7).

This module is the boundary between "tool-aware" and "tool-agnostic" code.
Providers (which know git, CI exports, trackers) fill in
:class:`EngineeringContext`; everything downstream reads only these models and
never learns which tool produced them.

All models are immutable (frozen) and carry the milestone's provenance spine:
a deterministic ``id``, a ``timestamp`` where the source has one, a ``source``
(provider name), a ``confidence``, and open ``metadata``. Relationships are
expressed later as Evidence Graph edges, not object references, so the models
stay flat and serializable.

Deliberately absent: diffs, patch text, file contents. Providers may read them
to compute categories and module mappings, but only summaries survive
normalization (the same lossy-by-design rule as waveform adapters): VeriTriage
must not drift into being a code browser, and the graph must stay small.

This module imports nothing from :mod:`veritriage.graph` or the providers.
