"""Learning feedback: the interface through which engineers correct the platform.

Milestone 4 deliberately ships the *interfaces and storage* for feedback, not
any learning. The contract is designed so online improvement can be added
later without touching the reasoning engine:

* Feedback is keyed by regression ID, so every judgment stays attached to the
  full stored record (graph, reasoning, classification) it judges.
* ``diagnosis`` and ``actual_root_cause`` give future components labeled
  outcomes: a signature whose regressions are repeatedly marked ``incorrect``
  is a candidate for a new rule or generator; confirmed root causes become
  the ``root_cause`` shown for similar failures.
* Per-recommendation votes (``useful_recommendations`` /
  ``false_recommendations``) let a future ranker reweight recommendation
  templates from evidence rather than intuition.

No model retraining is involved anywhere: improvement means better rules,
better priors, and better historical context, all deterministic.
