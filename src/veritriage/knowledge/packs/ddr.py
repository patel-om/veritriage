"""DDR / LPDDR SDRAM (with DFI) Knowledge Pack.

DRAM timing parameters, refresh discipline, and the DFI PHY interface. These
are the controller-side failures that corrupt data or hang a rank: a timing
constraint violated between commands, or a refresh that slips past its
interval.

Note: threshold-margin analysis (how close a number is to a limit) is not
expressible with today's presence-based clauses; these patterns fire on a
checker/monitor already reporting the violation. Numeric-comparison clauses
are a future matcher upgrade (context.md section 5.1).
