"""Learning Engine vocabulary (Milestone 13).

The artifacts the Learning Engine derives from recorded history, and the
context it hands forward to agents and the report. Like every model in this
package these are plain data importing nothing from the graph or engine
layers.

Everything here is deliberately explainable: an artifact carries how many
observations support it, which regressions those were, and a plain-language
summary. There are no vectors, no model weights, and no hidden state, so any
learned claim can be printed and argued with.
