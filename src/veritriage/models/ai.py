"""AI provider vocabulary (Milestone 17).

The structured objects exchanged with a generative provider. Like every model
in this package these are plain data importing nothing from the graph or engine
layers.

The shape encodes the milestone's law: a provider is handed a frozen
:class:`Prompt` built from cited platform objects and returns text. It never
receives a raw artifact, a store, a service, or a graph, so "providers render,
never reason" holds by construction rather than by convention.
