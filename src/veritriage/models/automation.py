"""Automation vocabulary (Milestone 18).

Events, triggers, rules, and action requests. Like every model in this package
these are plain data importing nothing from the graph or engine layers.

The shape encodes the milestone's law. An :class:`ActionRequest` is a *request*
naming a capability the workspace already has, never a callable and never code.
There is no field anywhere here that could carry a script, which is what makes
"actions never execute arbitrary code" structurally true rather than a policy.
