"""WorkspaceServices: the stable public API every client consumes.

The CLI and every MCP tool call these methods and nothing else, so
investigation logic exists exactly once and "adding a client" never means
"re-implementing the platform". Everything here is deterministic and AI-free;
the optional AI review stays outside the workspace entirely.

Return types are exclusively normalized models (from ``veritriage.models``,
the graph package, and the workspace's own API models): no ``ParseResult``,
parser, adapter, or provider object ever crosses this API
(``test_public_api_never_exposes_raw_parser_objects`` pins it). Raw artifact
paths go in; normalized objects come out.
