"""Verification Project Intelligence (M11).

A durable, structured understanding of a verification project, built before any
failure is analyzed: the verification equivalent of an IDE's code index. The
Project Model is a separate, persistent, content-addressed model (parallel to the
Knowledge Graph and the Regression Database) that never enters the Evidence Graph;
it reaches reasoning as injected rules that cite existing evidence, and the report
as context. See ``docs/PROJECT_INTELLIGENCE.md``.

``build_project_model`` is the composition root: gather partial models from every
available provider, run insights, then seal a deterministic identity and integrity
fingerprint. It performs no reasoning and touches source only through providers.
