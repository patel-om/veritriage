"""Milestone 15: Design Intelligence and the Design Graph.

Covers the milestone's guarantees, not just its features: the graph is derived
and never extracted; it never enters the Evidence Graph; it is deterministic;
every edge names the field it came from; inference is declared rather than
hidden; Project Intelligence is untouched; and, above all, a brand-new
structural facet needs only a registration (the crown-jewel architecture test at
the bottom of this file).
