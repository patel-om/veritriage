"""Milestone 11: Verification Project Intelligence (manifest-first increment).

Covers the milestone's guarantees, not just its features: a project is understood
before any failure is analyzed; the Project Model is deterministic and content
addressed; it never enters the Evidence Graph (it is a lens over it); it reaches
reasoning only through the standard rule interface; protocol identification reuses
the Knowledge Engine; and, above all, a brand-new project source needs only a new
provider (the crown-jewel architecture test at the bottom of this file).
