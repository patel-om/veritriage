"""Milestone 14: the Planning Engine.

Covers the milestone's guarantees, not just its features: the Planner
contributes structure and never content; it consumes conclusions without
changing them; it never executes anything; plans are deterministic down to the
ID digest; ordering is total and explainable; learning reprioritizes but never
adds steps; and, above all, a brand-new step source needs only a registration
(the crown-jewel architecture test at the bottom of this file).
