"""Architectural guards: the AI reasons over the Evidence Graph only.

These tests pin the boundary rather than the AI output (which needs a live
API): the AI stage must not touch the filesystem, its payload must contain
only normalized graph objects (never raw parser output), and its failure
mode without the optional dependency must be clean.
